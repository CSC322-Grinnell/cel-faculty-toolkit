About,/about,"What is a faculty toolkit? Toolkits seek to provide the background and methods to specific ways of thinking, doing, & assessing. This toolkit focuses on community-engaged learning, an approach to applied learning that is built on the foundation of intentional & mutally beneficial community partnerships. Community-engaged learning (C-EL) yields high potential for social impact when navigated through self-awareness and community input. This toolkit hopes to offer some ways to approach CEL. How do I use it? This toolkit is meant to fit the needs and skill set of its user. You may wish to read & explore from beginning to end OR read a certain section or subsection. Make the resource work for your project or goals. You will find context to community-engaged leartning, strategies to building community relationships, course design tips, and assessment & professional development resources."
Introduction,/what_is_cel#,
What is Community Engaged Learning CEL,/what_is_cel#section1,
Types of CEL spectrum,/what_is_cel#section1.1,"Firstly, how do we define community engagement?  It often looks like collaboration across groups of people affiliated by region/locality and specific concerns/interests. It can bring lasting change to a community, promoting well-being and mobilizes other resources, voices, concerns, in the process (PSU). Moreover, citizens are considered engaged when they play an active role in deliberation, discussion, decision-making, and/or implementation of projects that will affect them.  Therefore, community engaged learning connects community engagement to academic coursework and is based on the premise that rigorous learning comes from experiencing one’s broader studies, combined with analysis and reflection that affects future actions (Fordham).  At Grinnell, we understand community engaged learning as an ever evolving opportunity to enhance student learning through mutually beneficial classroom/community collaborations. Partnerships can bring community expertise in the classroom or the community can function as the focal point of a project or program. Community engaged learning, while student-focused, needs to emphasize community partners and members as a priority in the learning and resource creation it entails."
Community and Engagement,/what_is_cel#section1.2,"When defining a given community, important questions include:  Who represents the community? Who has influence in the community? Are key members represented in community-based organizations? Who has the time, resources, and ability to participate and/or take responsibility for action items? Who is defined as outside the community? No one organization or individual represents an entire community. Rather, communities exist in various and diverse sectors of a locale (Wallerstein et al., 2005). An individual can hold a sense of belonging to multiple communities and this sense of membership can evolve or change overtime (CDC).  Oversimplifying the complexity of communities can lead to the failure of well-intentioned community initiatives (Chavis & Lee, 2015). Understanding a community and its shared identities and networks is the first step to creating community partnerships and relationships integral to community engaged learning."
A Brief History of CEL in the US,/what_is_cel#section1.3,"Community engaged learning is not new to educational systems.The origins of community engaged learning has many outlets from diverse perspectives. At the beginning of the 19th century, American colleges and universities were becoming more prominent institutions in the civic tapestry of society. An early model for civic engagement in higher education was founded at the University of Wisconsin, Madison entitled the Wisconsin Idea. The model sought to apply specialized knowledge of students and faculty to civic issues towards a more democratic partnership between education and community networks (NLU). Progressive education, which began in the late 19th century, offered another early theoretical base for community engaged learning to evolve in the mid to late 20th century. John Dewey, a philosopher of education, led the progressive education movement, arguing that participatory and active learning reates knowledge and citizen development, which in turn leads to social change. A progressive cooperative education model was created at the University of Cincinnati, followed by the first community junior college in Joliet, Illinois.  As the 20th century took course, it was political and civic activism that shaped education. Education and anti-poverty leaders brought forth ideas on how to connect community and education, challenging the role of the university, the teacher, and the student. The settlement house movement and its champion, Jane Addams of Chicago, offered educational and employment resources to the urban poor, connecting learning to social reform. In the 1930s, the New Deal created the National Youth Administration which created employment and educational opportunities for young citizens. The Peace Corps followed in the 1960s. Social movements of the mid-20th century challenged universities to revise and develop courses and degrees which allowed students to study the injustices of their time and their heritage. In the late 1970s, the National Society for Internships and Experiential Education and the National"
The Liberal Arts and CEL,/what_is_cel#section2,"The Tradition of the Liberal Arts & Community Engaged Learning  Liberal arts institutions center on critical thinking, moral and civic character, and using knowledge to improve the world (Goodman, 2014).Critical thinking embodies the epistemic, or the coming to and utilization of knowledge. Moral/civic character is considered the eudemonic, or the realization of the student, which brings overall well-being. Lastly, improving the world through knowledge is articulated as the civic, where the ability to responsibly express individual freedom and contribute to the public good (Harward, 2007).  The goal of the liberal arts is to cultivate an ethos which creates life-long civically minded individuals. However, on most liberal arts campuses, students experience a fractured climate: “Students themselves are expected to integrate, cumulatively and developmental, what institutional structures and operations formally divide” (Harward, 2007). The classroom is understood as the singular site of academic learning, despite the rhetoric of the development of the whole student and their responsibility to the locale in which they learn.   Personalized pedagogy can be mistaken for the decolonial transformation that critical community engagement seeks, an environment that  is “...less interested in decolonizing the university and more in operating as a decolonizing university (Third Uni.).” Therefore, community engaged learning acts as an excellent vehicle for true student engagement- because such courses and projects require active participation and thus have the greatest potential to “transform attitudes, behaviors, dispositions” (Harward, 2007). Evidence suggests that the more the student is involved, the more they understand how the issues they study relate to the world outside the academic classroom. This challenges students to reflect on their own responsibilities and roles in the larger mosaic of civic life.  Furthermore, students report that they feel they are surprised by how much they learn in a space where the emphasis i"
CEL at Grinnell College,/what_is_cel#section2.1,"At Grinnell College, a liberal arts education equips students with the language and knowledge to convey ideas, analyze and formulate issues and solutions, observe and experiment, and express creatively.   A larger question found in the humanities  and found in the Grinnell classroom is, “In what ways have people lived together, and how should they live together?” Community engaged learning seeks to act as a bridge between the college and the local community. How can the Grinnell College community live with the larger Grinnell community? The college being an integral part of the region, coursework can become better embedded in the social, economic, and cultural networks of the town. This embedeness, when done with careful planning and equitable execution, can allow students to further the skills gained through a liberal arts education.   In rural America, where many liberal arts colleges are located, high poverty levels are commonly found due to changing economic industries and subsequently, fewer employment options. Therefore, “It is crucial that we sensitize students to the realities of rural areas and small towns and that working in civic engagement activities in such places can be, very different…” (Schon, 1983).  It is in such climates, nonprofits and universities can act as vehicles for the community to address its unique needs and challenges (Goodman, 2014). Community engaged learning is evolving as less driven by individual faculty interests, which tend to vary, but more by the strengths and obstacles of the place in which the college is situated, to the “particularities of place” (Heffner et. al, 2006). Viewing this education as part of student and faculty life, learning can be fully integrated between personal, academic, and civic dimensions of growth.  Grinnell seeks to move from traditional ‘service learning,’ and continue to move towards critical community engaged learning. This differentiation is one that understands service components in higher education as sustainable and transformational rather th"
Faculty motivations,/what_is_cel#section2.2,"Why community engaged learning? It creates opportunities for projects and initiatives to be supported, and when done ethically and with transparency, ignites engagement both within the community and university. It creates more sustainable and useful solutions by identifying and supporting local knowledge in problem solving. This builds common ground and networks for further relationship development.It increases trust in the college or university and can improve communication and collaboration in larger ways (PSU).  What factors pull certain faculty to community engaged work? What are their motivations?If community engaged learning is for you, it is important to consider your own motivations to participate. Both traditional academic professionals and engaged scholars have their unique strengths and value knowledge, but the engaged scholar has more committed interest in communicating the knowledge externally.  No matter the positionality of faculty, there should be a sense of the public purpose of higher education in one’s work (Koritz et. al, 2016).One may look to two major sets of influences, those that are (1) intrinsic, and those that are (2) extrinsic.  Intrinsic looks at how work is done and how it may affect faculty, and the autonomy and feedback associated with the work. Extrinsic focuses on outside factors like environment and conditions of how the work is done. It is the balance between the two that seems to determine faculty motivations- between self and social knowledge (Omeara, 2007).Furthermore, it is important to consider what faculty are learning through community engaged work that continually draws them to cultivating partnerships outside academia.  Motivations broken down ( Adapted from Omeara, 2007) One type of motivation is not necessarily better than another and it is truly in understanding why Faculty become involved, that the institution can better support community engaged learning.

"Power, Privilege, and Bias in Campus Community Partnerships",/what_is_cel#section3,
Power and Privilege,/what_is_cel#section3.1,"Despite the social justice orientation often found in community engaged learning classes, the demographics of the students which either choose to enroll and/or have the privilege to enroll, lack diversity. The whiteness of higher education impacts all sections of academic experience, from what literature is studied, to the applications seen in service learning.“Nearly every community-campus partnership is well-meaning but imbalanced, rife with challenges related to the unequal distribution of wealth, resources, power, and access” (Peterson, 2018).  Higher education reflects institutionalized inequalities, and community engaged learning is no exception.Moreover, “The invisibility and normative privileges of witness shape service learning and are reinforced by service learning, particularly when so many practitioners in the field assume ‘an ideal type’...one who volunteers her time, has high cultural capital, and gains from contact with the ‘other’” (Mitchell et. al, 2012). Faculty can fall into this trap as well in being too nervous to discuss racial assumptions of white students in service settings."
Identity and Community Engagement,/what_is_cel#section3.2,"In Paola Friere’s Pedagogy of the Oppressed (1970), Friere introduces the concept of ‘banking education.’ Banking education reflects the traditional relationship of teacher/professor and student, where freedom of thought for the student essentially does not exist. In community engaged learning, students and community members are allowed a much larger role in the learning process, where the power of knowledge is ideally dismantled. When considering how to be more inclusive in community engaged pedagogy, the solution, according to Friere, is not to integrate underrepresented identities into a structure lacking diversity, but to transform the structure itself (Freire 1970, 74).  It is thus vital that as faculty ask:(1) who are my students, and (2) how do I know such information.  Faculty and students both should ask themselves:Why am I interested in community-engaged learning? What can I do to affect change on the issue of focus? Faculty should offer opportunities for students to connect their experiences in the field to their own backgrounds, experiences, and beliefs (Mitchell et. al, 2012).To create more critical approaches to community engaged learning, exploring identity is central- the identity of the instructor, the students, and the community partners. It is when identity is at the forefront that the complexities of social issues are most understood and power structures can be transformed (Mitchell 2017). Bringing this whole self into the class gives authentic space to reflect on the intersections of one’s values, foundations, and passions and how such identities connect and differ. Stronger relationships spanning traditional hierarchies are built as a direct result (Peterson, 2018)."
Community Partnerships,/community_partnerships#,
"Place, Community & Anti-Racism",/community_partnerships#section1,
Historical Context,/community_partnerships#section1.1,"Understand and Get to Know the Area You Wish to Collaborate With There is a need to unlearn our perceptions of the identity of a space because such information has traditionally been taught from the position of power over the narrative (Creative Reaction Lab).Grinnell College offers a unique resource for its faculty, the Social Justice Tour. It is an in-person and remote tour of the Grinnell region which highlights the systems at play which affect poverty education, wellness, and social mobility in the community. The social justice tour embodies the belief that in order to create and maintain mutually beneficial community-university relationships, the academic institution’s participants are much better prepared when they have the historical context of the community and associated histories of inequality. What is community asset mapping ? It is a strengths-based approach to community development. It is meant to document a community’s resources by identifying institutions, organizations, individuals, etc. that are knowledgeable resources. Approaching communities members and organizations from this perspective empowers them to recognize and harness the abilities, ideas, and resources they already hold. Without framing the service component to a community engaged class in the context of community strengths and assets, students may create assumptions that the community has nothing to offer in terms of learning. It is, in fact, the capacities of community members which can build sustainable innovation (Duncan). There are different types of asset mapping including cultural and community relationship mapping. Cultural mapping documents cultural resources in a community, and may look at long-term customs or traditions or bring self-awareness to the unique histories and identities of a region. Community relationship mapping links organizations and how missions across the region may be able to better collaborate or indicate gaps in linkage."
Asset Mapping & Community Agency,/community_partnerships#section1.2,"Key Questions to reflect on before beginning community asset mapping (ABCD Report,Duncan): What is your organization’s relationship to community residents? How accountable is your organization to the people and community it serves? How do you define and engage constituents? What power do they have? How does your institution seek to strengthen community relationships? What can you do to make your partnership more asset-based? Who do you hire from the town/city/neighborhood? Which groups do you belong to or meet with regularly? What do you feel you contribute to the town/city/neighborhood and what else might you contribute? Guidelines for Creating & Maintaining Meaningful Community-Engaged Partnerships When forming intentional partnerships, the Grinnell College community subscribes to and practices the certain key principles in all service, social innovation, and volunteer work. These principles guide in creating and sustaining healthy, reciprocal relationships. Partnerships form to serve a specific purpose and may take on new goals over time. Partners actively strive to understand each other's needs and self-interests, and develop a common language. The partnership builds upon identified strengths and assets, but also works to address needs and increase capacity or growth of all partners. The partnership seeks to balance power and share resources among partners. All partners have input in establishing clearly articulated principles and processes for the partnership. Partners seek to agree upon a mission, values, goals, measurable outcomes, and accountability for their partnership. There is feedback among all stakeholders in the partnership, with the goal of continuously improving the partnership and its outcomes. Partners share the benefits of the partnership's accomplishments. Partnerships can dissolve and may need to plan a process for closure."
Stakeholders/Gatekeepers/Informants,/community_partnerships#section1.3,"Building Community Partnerships for Community Engaged Learning One way to begin building community partnerships is through interviewing gatekeepers, key informants and stakeholders. Community input is vital in beginning to build a community engaged project, and gatekeepers, key informants, and stakeholders need to be communicated with during and after a course or initiative has completed- where they are treated as leaders and decision-makers throughout the entire process. Gatekeepers are community members and experts that are well known and hold respect in the community among its formally and informally identified leaders. Key informants have contributed time and work in the community and have specialized knowledge about the community. Stakeholders are the individuals or groups affected by issues and partnerships. Stakeholders Who will be affected by this community-university collaboration? Who may receive the positive or negative results of the partnership? What is the cost/benefit position of all stakeholders involved? Stakeholders groups and individuals should be linked to specific engagement goals. This includes (1) creating a communication line to inform and consult (2) ongoing collaboration opportunities including dialogue and deliberation (3) sharing leadership and supporting stakeholders in implementing goals and solutions (PSU). You should not expect to approach each community partner in the same way. It is important to understand your audience and communicate in a way that is attune to the partner’s lens and perspectives. Ask open ended questions, where sharing stories of the community is welcomed and respected."
Building Equitable Relationships,/community_partnerships#section2,
"Cultural Competency, Humility, and Empathy",/community_partnerships#section2.1,"Partnerships with universities are often not at the forefront of community member participation because of a variety of social, economic, and cultural responsibilities and barriers.The privilege of time can limit the involvement of community partners and members who are willing and interested in collaboration. Therefore, it is integral that partnerships reflect values, structures, and systems that meet the needs and responsibilities of the community. Cultural competency, humility, and empathy are ongoing skills to develop in working with community partners (Giachello, 2007) as “equal partnerships have yet to be realized on a broad scale...partnerships are often driven by priorities and requirements funding agencies and higher education institutions (CCPH, 2007).” Knowledge and application of this uneven terrain is a first step to creating more sustainable relationships and projects. Cultural competency allows you to collaborate effectively with individuals or groups who come from diverse ethnic, racial, religious, or economic perspectives and experiences Cultural humility is the continuous self-reflection and self-awareness of power imbalances when seeking to understand another’s emotions, ideas, experiences and a commitment to developing equitable partnerships for change. Empathy is the active intention of understanding another’s point of view by imagining how you would feel, think, or act in their situation (CRL)."
Public Impact Spectrum,/community_partnerships#section2.2,"How to Make Community Partnerships Work Public Participation Spectrum The public participation spectrum represents the goals and promises made to community partners and/or members when conducting interorganizational partnerships. The spectrum has 5 stages: (1) inform, (2) consult, (3) involve, (4) collaborate, (5) empower"
Co-Creation & Equity-Centered Design,/community_partnerships#section2.3,"What is co-creation? In dreaming and then articulating an action plan, co-creation is key. A key part of community partnerships is the method of co-creation. Co-creation sees equal collaboration as central to social innovation and change-making. Social innovation is defined as development and implementation of new ideas to meet social issues and challenges (Pulford et. al). Furthermore, co-creation is a key piece of equity centered community design, which exists at the intersection of community development, problem solving, and equitable outcomes. Anyone can be an equity designer- being anyone who has the agency to make decisions that can impact people or spaces (Creative Reaction Lab Field Guide). To dismantle unequal systems for equity centered design, one first must understand how these systems currently function. Understand if you are part of the system(s) and how. POWER What kinds of power do you hold that are helpful to yourself and others? What kinds of power do you hold that can be harmful? Are there ways you can share your power, reposition, or give it up ? “Every decision we make has an impact on equity.” When we co-create, the safe space of multiple and diverse voices only can enrichen knowledge building, problem solving, and implementation methods. Co-creation allows us to identify and celebrate shared values in a partnership and move away from focusing on individual contributions and towards teamwork and end results. There is no one way to co-create as it varies from situation to situation. Knowledge is understood as the driving point of collaboration, not positionality - recognize the vital role of community experts in community engaged work. Failure is recognized as part of the process. Consider the differences between co-creation and community participation and dialogue...Is everyone an active member? Furthermore, co-creation seeks design that leads to social sustainability. What does quality look like and how can we grow projects that work?"
Capacity Building,/community_partnerships#section2.4,"What is capacity building? In order for change to take place in the community, partnerships need to be sustained. Capacity building is the process of creating and maintaining resources which are meant to last and that hold active and future value to the individuals and groups who have access to them. Capacity building projects support an organization's ability to not only survive but hopefully, thrive. Transformational capacity building creates systems and structures that can help address and overcome challenges and considers the intersectional factors at hand. For example, capacity building that is transformational should not assimilate to white professionalism values including individualism, technical solutions, written word, or productivity. An ‘obsession’ with effectiveness can actually cause more harm than good. Understanding what capacity looks like changes from organization to organization (Nishimura et. al, 2020). Build culturally sound relationships rooted in trust through an understanding of cultural dynamics of the community. Transparency and vulnerability must exist on all sides. Consider the larger ecosystem. What do collective actions toward capacity look like? When possible, support and champion the development and well-being of community leaders. See the positive possibilities of power when it is equitably distributed. Logic Modeling Community-university partnerships are organizational relationships with many moving parts. Setting expectations and understanding what resources are available from your own institution is an important first step. Planning needs to be inclusive, from defining the purpose and needs of the partnership to establishing attainable learning goals for students. Once a solid relationship has been formed with a community partner or group and you feel ready to articulate your interest in co-creation, make your proposal clear- in that roles are transparent and it is understood what is expected of each party. Sharing a common set of standards can guide follow through of initiatives and support mutually beneficial results. Furthermore, partnerships for engagement should look at the potential of sustained effort and social change that put quality first. A logic model can help assess this potential outcome for change. A logic model is a picture of how your project/idea is supposed to function. It explains how and why a strategy is a good solution to the issue of focus. A logic model is also referred to as a road map or conceptual map, blueprint, casual chain or program framework. Logic models consider how certain elements and relationships work together.

Course Design,/course_design#,
Getting Started,/course_design#section1,
Assessing Prior Knowledge,/course_design#section1.1,"Assessing Prior Knowledge One way to identify student gaps in shaping your syllabus can be through designing and implementing a background knowledge assessment. Determine what students already may know Target gaps in learning or assumptions/misconceptions related to the discipline Link student’s previous knowledge to new course material Assessments should be anonymous and clarify it is an ungraded assignment. Qualtrics can be used to create, share, and process the questions. Share data collected with students and have transparency in the data’s use. What does learning look like between faculty, students, and community partners?"
Theories of learning & cel,/course_design#section1.2,"For faculty who are interested in and prepared to incorporate civic pedagogies into the classroom, there is real value in integrating the role of teaching and researching into community engaged work. In building community partnerships, a continued openness to what academic work looks like and what opportunities for collaboration are possible, is central to building relationships in this field: “Both academia and the non-profit sector are extremely complex and diverse but nevertheless identifiable subcultures characterized by distinctive values, goals, and worldviews. In the interest of maintaining respectful and productive service-learning partnerships, we continually seek to more deeply understand the two cultures, our common ground, and our differences” (Bacon, 2002). Faculty and community partners each come from diverse backgrounds and professional climates and may understand student learning differently. Bacon (2002) found that faculty member’s theories of learning align traditionally with a cognitivist perspective, while community partners align more closely with a situationist perspective. Faculty, in this study, tended to see students entering into a community project with certain knowledge, and the experience with community partners allows them to break down their ideas, categorize them, and apply them to the experience. Community partners saw student learning as directly affected by experience, and that changes in behavior were factors of the experience. Acknowledging this dichotomy, Bacon argued that faculty must take interest in the experiences and perspectives of community partners. A merging of cognitivist and situationist theories is ideally where partnerships land, seeing truth to both perspectives in community engaged learning."

Checklist,/course_design#section2,
Steps to Guide Design,/course_design#section2.1,"Phases to Follow 3 months to 1 year prior to start of course Develop a course structure and draft syllabus, build learning goals and student, community, and faculty roles “Identifying a gap between the students’ current level and desired level of attitude, knowledge, or skill is key. An educational need is something individuals should learn for their own good, for the good of their organization or profession, or for the good of society” (Knowles, 1970). Determine any specific funding needs (grant funding- i.e. Mellon HIA) (campus partnerships, funds) Meet with community partners to discuss scale, scope, final products and any requirements for students Identify strategies for integrating community engaged learning and traditional classroom learning with appropriate assignments, readings, lectures, speakers, discussions, field trips Select and define relevant and effective reflection exercises Develop forms for working with community partners i.e. a memorandum of understanding (MOU) No later than 1 month before course begins Formalize course expectations and deliverables with community partner Coordinate schedule for course with community partners Finalize and confirm the MOU between Grinnell and community partners Finalize funding sources and logistics including travel if appropriate Edit and finalize syllabus."
Faculty/Student/Community Partner Roles,/course_design#section2.2,"Some important questions and pieces to reflect on when designing the course: (SUNY Binghamton/ UC Berkeley Digital Toolkits) Faculty How will community engagement fit into my scholarship and research goals? What areas of my field am I most interested in exploring? What issues are important to me and what individuals or organizations are focusing on solutions to these issues? Is there anyone on campus who is producing similar work? Do I need help getting started? Where do my own strengths lie? How much time do you have to develop and implement the course? What kind of community engaged component makes the most sense for my course? How will I prepare students for engaged work? How will I facilitate? Students What are the learning goals for students in this course? Have I designed learning goals which reflect the needs and goals of the community partners? What will the specific role of the student look like? How much time will students spend working with community partners? How may the course impact civic engagement and professional opportunities for students involved? How do I plan to connect community engaged work to classroom content? How will I document and assess student learning? Communiy Partners Do I need help identifying and connecting with community partners? What kind of criteria do I have for selecting community partners? Who has identified the issue being addressed in the course? What kind of skills and expertise does each individual/group bring to partnership? What role will community partners play in developing and implementing the course? What role will community partners play in evaluating student work and the course? Once the course has finished, are there possibilities for ongoing collaboration?"
Designing Sustainability,/course_design#section2.3,"Developing a community engaged syllabus is a complex process but can follow a set of actions that help keep your goals and progress on track. Refer to this checklist as you develop: Have I clarified mutual learning goals with community partners? Have I made clear connections between service and coursework? Have I created and communicated clear expectations for students? Have I communicated to students the importance of respectful and appreciative relationships in working with community partners? Have I planned out the time commitments needed for quality community collaboration, (self) assessment, and reflection? Have I articulated how student work will be evaluated (journals, papers, presentations)? Sustainable Teaching & Learning When designing the syllabus, it is critical to think long term. Why do we want to sustain? “Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” (Vanderbilt) What broader goals does your course seek? What are the larger social justice issues you want your students to address? How does the topic of your course connect to issues of diversity, equity, civic responsibility, and compassion? The core of building sustainable community-university relationships."
